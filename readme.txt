Update 1:
Idea of this game:
The player model is a flying saucer that shoots a beam
to teleport people onto the ship.
As of now, I have implemented movement for both the
FlyingSaucer and Beam classes.
Also as of now, the Flying Saucer and the beam are
just rectangles.

After this, I plan on adding music.
Then I plan on making the people respond to the location
of the flying saucer.

I will wait to sync my other files to this repo until
I know this idea is ok.
