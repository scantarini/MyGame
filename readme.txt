Update 1:
Idea of this game:
The player model is a flying saucer that shoots a beam
to teleport people onto the ship.
As of now, I have implemented movement for both the
FlyingSaucer and Beam classes.
Also as of now, the Flying Saucer and the beam are
just rectangles.

After this, I plan on adding music.
Then I plan on making the people respond to the location
of the flying saucer.

I will wait to sync my other files to this repo until
I know this idea is ok.

Update 2:
I have the human class made.
Each human has a variable walking/running speed.
I plan on having the player fire additional objects
that will target the slowest-walking person that is
not already targeted.
I plan on implementing this using a priority queue
and smart pointers.
